ðŸ‘‹ Hello!

Thanks for checking out my personal npm package ðŸ˜‚

While I'm not building useless stuff I build [joinglimpse.com](joinglimpse.com). We're about to launch a community platform that, _for the first time_, focuses on people -- not posts/content/ads/etc.

We were tired of a lackluster Slack + Notion + Airtable + GSuite concoction, as it lacked both engagement and a sense of togetherness. We tried switching from FB Groups to GroupMe to Discord... only to repeat it the next year.

Communities deserve a home, and 2020 showed us how human connection is more important than ever.
